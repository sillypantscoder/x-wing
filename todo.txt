🐛🌟🤷‍♂️⚠️💣

🌟 Players hardcoded to Jason

Currently:
STARTING phase:
- 🐛 cannot add new players
- 🌟 can add ships
  - 🐛 placed randomly
  - 🌟 ships are actually associated with players
- 🌟 once everyone has pressed ready, switches to planning
  - 🐛 can't un-ready yourself
  - 🐛 can't see who else is ready
    - 🐛 Add a player status bar!
PLANNING phase:
- 🌟 Can choose and change selected maneuver for each ship
  - Doesn't handle collisions, but maybe that's only for the actual moving
  phase. i.e. during planning you can totally plan to fly through someone.
  - 🐜 distances aren't correct (inconsistent arc length, Augusto claims)
- 🌟 once everyone has set their maneuvers, switches to moving
  - 🌟 press "Ready" button after setting maneuvers
- 🤷‍♂️ needs to be able to reset to this phase after a refresh
- 🤷‍♂️ need to be able to send the player's chosen maneuvers to the client!
  - 🤷‍♂️ reload maneuvers if you reload the page
  - ⚠️💣 also send maneuvers during moving phase
- 🌟 have a cool event class! yay!
- 🌟 have really long 103-character-long method names 🥇

MOVING phase:
  - 🐛 need to correctly determine the order of the ships
    - 🐛 need to know which players are empire or rebel to do this correctly
  - 🐛 ping-pong between clients and server to actually execute the moving phase

COMBAT phase:
  - 🐛 needs to be done
    - 🐛 needs to be started

TODO:
- Add new players
- Allow explicit placement & orientation of ships
