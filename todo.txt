🐛🌟🤷‍♂️⚠️💣☐☑

🌟 Players hardcoded to Jason

Structural TODO:
Make game phases a more self-contained data structure. In particular, it would
be really nice to be able to define a phase in terms of:
  -- what happens when a phase is entered
  ---- the sequence of interactions that occur within a phase, like:
    - per ship stuff
    - per player stuff
    - synchronization points
    - UI notifications and interactions
  -- what happens right before leaving a phase


Currently:
STARTING phase:
- 🐛 cannot add new players
- 🌟 can add ships
  - 🐛 placed randomly
  - 🌟 ships are actually associated with players
- 🌟 once everyone has pressed ready, switches to planning
  - 🐛 can't un-ready yourself
PLANNING phase:
- 🌟 Can choose and change selected maneuver for each ship
  - Doesn't handle collisions, but maybe that's only for the actual moving
  phase. i.e. during planning you can totally plan to fly through someone.
  - 🐜 distances aren't correct (inconsistent arc length, Augusto claims)
- 🌟 once everyone has set their maneuvers, switches to moving
  - 🌟 press "Ready" button after setting maneuvers
- ✅ needs to be able to reset to this phase after a refresh
- ✅ need to be able to send the player's chosen maneuvers to the client!
  - ✅ reload maneuvers if you reload the page
  - ✅ also send maneuvers during moving phase
- 🌟 have a cool event class! yay!
- 🌟 have really long 103-character-long method names 🥇

MOVING phase:
  - 🐛 need to correctly determine the order of the ships
    - 🐛 need to know which players are empire or rebel to do this correctly
  - 🐛 ping-pong between clients and server to actually execute the moving phase

COMBAT phase:
  - 🐛 needs to be done
    - 🐛 needs to be started

TODO now:
☑ Make small loop

☑ Add teams to ships.txt file
☑ Add teams!
☑ Let players choose their teams at the beginning
☑ Filter list of ships depending on your team
☑ Color code players

☑ Add actions to ships.txt file
☑ Allow players to choose actions (maybe in the status bar?)
☐ *Sync actions with client side!*
☐ Get actions working:
  ☐ Focus
  ☐ Evade
  ☐ Barrel roll
☐ Make sure actions can work after refreshing

☐ Verify that different ships can have different size icons, and that collision
  detection does all the right stuff.
☐ Have different icons for different ships
☐ Delete ships during starting phase

☐ Work on attacking phase!

☐ Move ships as far as possible on collision

TODO later:
- ☑ Add new players
- Add zooming of the map
